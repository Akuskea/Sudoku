# Sudoku
The project is to create a Pseudo-Sudoku (PS), a simpler version of a Sudoku puzzle, but without any 3x3 Block or Nonet constraint requirement, as is the case of the conventional 9x9 Sudoku. The board size nxn may vary arbitrarily, and for a valid PS board, each row should be completed with numbers 1 through n (for n x n board) without repetition of any number, and so does each of the columns. The given input PS board has some empty entries. The algorithm for solving it must fill in these empty items with values satisfying the constraints and compare their time-complexities against the problem size, represented by two parameters, n, and m where n is the board size and m is the number of empty entries.

The second Sudoku compares the time-complexities of Backtracking and Foward checking, then display their plots. The result is that the time complexity of the forward-checking algorithm grows much slower than the backtracking algorithm. The result makes sense, as the forward-checking algorithm prunes more possibilities early in the search process, reducing the search space and the time needed to find a solution. Overall, those plots confirm that the forward-checking algorithm is more efficient than the backtracking algorithm, especially for larger puzzle sizes and higher numbers of empty cells.
